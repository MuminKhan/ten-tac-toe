# ten-tac-toe

## About 
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game meant to be played with a 10-key (numeric keyboard). In it's current form, it's merely a proof of concept to garner customer feedback. At this point, I've opted to encapsulate all game logic into a single .py file for ease of use. Further iterations on this game would re-organize the code into a more development friendly structure.

## Usage
Invoke the supplied `ten-tac-toe.py` with any 3.6+ python interpreter as such:

```sh
python3 ten-tac-toe.py
```
